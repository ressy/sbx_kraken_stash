# Kraken, using a locally-stashed database

This extension will stash a copy of a Kraken 1 database to a specified
location, keep that copy cached in memory with [vmtouch], and run [Sunbeam]'s
kraken rules using the stashed database.  vmtouch isn't currently in the common
conda channels as far as I can see, so this currently requires a vmtouch
executable on your PATH.

I've found this to be necessary on one particularly strange filesystem
([IBM Spectrum Scale]) due to the [GPFS pagepool] configuration.
This should *not* be needed on either NFS or any common local filesystem, since
[the ordinary caching in Linux](https://www.linuxatemyram.com/) works as
expected for those.
